# 4ACTIVE Manual Testing Project

This repository showcases my manual testing project for the **4ACTIVE** gym class management web application. It includes detailed documentation of software requirements, test cases, defect reports, and testing protocols.

### Testing

The application underwent comprehensive testing to ensure functionality. Key test cases included:
- **Verify Gym Schedule Visibility**: Ensured all users can view the gym schedule.
- **Class Sign-Up Functionality**: Confirmed that registered users can sign up for available classes.
- **Unsubscribe Functionality**: Identified a failure in the confirmation pop-up after class unsubscription.

For a complete list of test cases, please refer to the [Test Protocol Document](link-to-test-protocol) (available in this repository). For more details on the project requirements and specifications, kindly check the [Confluence Document](link-to-confluence) (available in this repository).

### Note
The Confluence and Test Protocol documents are included in this repository for reference.
