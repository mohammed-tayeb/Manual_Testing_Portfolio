# 4ACTIVE Manual Testing Project

This repository showcases my manual testing project for the **4ACTIVE** gym class management web application. It includes detailed documentation of software requirements, test cases, defect reports, and testing protocols that I have developed. 

The 4ACTIVE gym class management web application is a real platform accessible at [4-active.pl](https://4-active.pl/). As an active member of this gym, I frequently use the website, which motivated me to use it as a template for my manual testing project. This choice allows you to easily access the site and follow along with my testing examples.

For this project, I focused on two main features:

- **Admin Class Management:** This feature allows gym administrators to create, modify, and delete classes offered at the gym. Admins can also manage class schedules and capacities, ensuring that members have access to a variety of fitness options.

- **Member Class Management:** This functionality enables members to view available classes, sign up for sessions, and manage their bookings. Members can also unsubscribe from classes they no longer wish to attend.

### Testing

The application underwent comprehensive testing to ensure functionality. Key test cases included:
- **Verify Gym Schedule Visibility**: Ensured all users can view the gym schedule.
- **Class Sign-Up Functionality**: Confirmed that registered users can sign up for available classes.
- **Unsubscribe Functionality**: Identified a failure in the confirmation pop-up after class unsubscription.
